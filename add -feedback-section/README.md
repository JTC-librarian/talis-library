The script here takes a file of lists from the Talis Aspire reports tool, and adds to the top of each list in that file a 'give us some feedback' paragraph (providing that it does not exist already).

It uses the talis.py module that is in the main directory of this repository, and if you want to use it you should read the main README and be aware of how amateruish this scripting is, the alternatives, etc.
